## What it Does 

### Problem Statement 
Globally, **privacy in AI** is becoming increasingly important as users lose control over their personal data. Traditional AI systems operate as black boxes, making decisions without explicit user consent, often collecting and processing personal information without transparency. Current AI assistants lack cryptographic verification of user permissions, leading to unauthorized data access and privacy violations.

### Hushh's Solution 

- **Cryptographically Enforced Consent through HushhMCP**  
  Every AI agent action requires explicit user permission through cryptographically signed consent tokens.  
   *Our Solution:* HushhMCP (Micro Consent Protocol) ensures that no agent can access or process data without verified user consent, using HMAC-SHA256 signatures for tamper-proof permission verification.

- **Multi-Agent AI Ecosystem**  
  A comprehensive platform featuring 5+ specialized AI agents working in harmony.  
   *Our Solution:* MailerPanda for email marketing, ChanduFinance for financial advice, Relationship Memory for context management, AddToCalendar for scheduling, and Research agents for information gathering.

- **Privacy-First Architecture with End-to-End Encryption**  
  Built from the ground up with privacy as the core principle, not an afterthought.  
   *Our Solution:* AES-256-GCM encryption for all personal data, local data processing options, and complete user control over data sharing and agent permissions.

###  **3. Relationship Memory Agent - Persistent Context and Interaction Management**

Modern AI systems often lack context about previous interactions, making conversations feel impersonal and repetitive. The Relationship Memory Agent maintains **persistent memory** of user interactions, preferences, and relationships, enabling all other agents to provide more contextual and personalized responses.

### How it Works 

**Context Storage and Retrieval:**
1. Every interaction across all agents is analyzed and key information is extracted
2. Important details about relationships, preferences, and user behavior are stored securely
3. Context is retrieved and provided to agents during future interactions
4. Memory is organized by relationships, topics, and temporal relevance

**Cross-Agent Memory Sharing:**
1. Memory is shared across all agents in the ecosystem with user consent
2. MailerPanda can access relationship context for better personalization
3. ChanduFinance can consider family situation and financial relationships
4. All agents benefit from accumulated context for improved interactions

**Privacy-Preserving Memory Management:**
1. All stored memories are encrypted using AES-256-GCM
2. Users can view, edit, or delete any stored memories
3. Automatic expiration for sensitive information based on user preferences
4. Granular controls over what information is remembered and shared

### What Sets Relationship Memory Apart 

- **Cross-Agent Context:** Unlike isolated AI systems, our memory agent provides context to all agents in the ecosystem, creating a truly cohesive experience.
- **User-Controlled Memory:** Complete transparency and control over what is remembered, with easy editing and deletion capabilities.
- **Intelligent Context Extraction:** Advanced NLP techniques identify and store the most relevant information from conversations automatically.

### Technical Details

| API Route | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| /agents/relationship_memory/execute | Store and retrieve relationship context |
| /agents/relationship_memory/query | Search memories by person, topic, or timeframe |
| /agents/relationship_memory/manage | View, edit, or delete stored memories |
| /agents/relationship_memory/privacy | Configure memory retention and sharing settings |

**Memory Storage Example:**
`json
{
    "user_id": "user_123",
    "token": "HCT:memory_consent_token",
    "user_input": "Remember that John's birthday is next month and he likes coffee",
    "context_type": "relationship_detail",
    "retention_period": "1_year"
}
`
