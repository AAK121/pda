# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Proactive Relationship Manager Agent transforms the current reactive relationship memory system into an intelligent, proactive assistant that initiates conversations, provides timely reminders, and manages relationships efficiently. The agent will proactively check for upcoming events, suggest reconnections based on interaction history, handle batch contact operations, and provide conversational advice based on stored memories.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Proactive Event Detection and Notification

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to automatically check for upcoming birthdays, anniversaries, and reconnection opportunities when I start the system, so that I never miss important relationship moments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent starts up THEN the system SHALL check for upcoming birthdays within the next 30 days
2. WHEN the agent starts up THEN the system SHALL check for anniversaries within the next 30 days  
3. WHEN the agent starts up THEN the system SHALL identify contacts needing reconnection based on priority and last interaction date
4. WHEN proactive triggers are found THEN the system SHALL generate a consolidated, natural language notification message
5. WHEN high priority contacts have not been contacted for more than 7 days THEN the system SHALL suggest reconnection
6. WHEN medium priority contacts have not been contacted for more than 30 days THEN the system SHALL suggest reconnection
7. WHEN low priority contacts have not been contacted for more than 90 days THEN the system SHALL suggest reconnection

### Requirement 2: Batch Contact Management

**User Story:** As a user, I want to add multiple contacts with their details in a single command, so that I can efficiently import my contact list without repetitive individual entries.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I provide multiple contact details in one input THEN the system SHALL parse and extract each contact as a separate entity
2. WHEN processing batch contacts THEN the system SHALL validate each contact individually
3. WHEN batch processing completes THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of successful additions and any errors
4. WHEN a contact already exists during batch processing THEN the system SHALL update the existing contact with new information
5. WHEN batch processing encounters an error for one contact THEN the system SHALL continue processing remaining contacts
6. WHEN I input "add contacts: John with email john@email.com and Sarah at 555-1234" THEN the system SHALL create two separate contact records

### Requirement 3: Enhanced Contact Data Model

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to track contact priority levels and last interaction dates, so that the agent can intelligently suggest when to reconnect with people.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a new contact THEN the system SHALL allow setting priority as high, medium, or low (default: medium)
2. WHEN creating a new contact THEN the system SHALL allow setting the last talked date
3. WHEN adding a memory for a contact THEN the system SHALL automatically update the last talked date to current date
4. WHEN updating contact information THEN the system SHALL preserve existing priority and last talked date unless explicitly changed
5. WHEN retrieving contact information THEN the system SHALL include priority and last talked date in the response

### Requirement 4: Conversational Advice Generation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to ask the agent for advice about my contacts based on stored memories, so that I can get personalized suggestions for gifts, conversation topics, or relationship management.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I ask for advice about a specific contact THEN the system SHALL retrieve relevant memories for that contact
2. WHEN generating advice THEN the system SHALL use stored memories to provide contextual suggestions
3. WHEN I ask "what should I get Jane for her birthday?" THEN the system SHALL analyze Jane's memories and preferences to suggest appropriate gifts
4. WHEN providing advice THEN the system SHALL reference specific memories or interactions to support recommendations
5. WHEN no relevant memories exist for advice THEN the system SHALL acknowledge the limitation and suggest gathering more information

### Requirement 5: Proactive Conversation Initiation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the agent to start conversations and ask for updates about my contacts, so that I maintain active engagement with my relationship network.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent detects upcoming events THEN the system SHALL generate engaging conversation starters
2. WHEN suggesting reconnection THEN the system SHALL provide context about the last interaction
3. WHEN multiple proactive triggers exist THEN the system SHALL consolidate them into a single, coherent message
4. WHEN generating proactive messages THEN the system SHALL use a friendly, conversational tone
5. WHEN I respond to a proactive suggestion THEN the system SHALL continue the conversation contextually

### Requirement 6: Enhanced LangGraph Workflow

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the agent to use an enhanced LangGraph workflow that supports proactive triggers and batch operations, so that the system can handle complex relationship management scenarios efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the agent starts THEN the workflow SHALL begin with proactive trigger checking
2. WHEN proactive triggers are found THEN the workflow SHALL route to proactive response generation
3. WHEN no proactive triggers exist THEN the workflow SHALL proceed to normal intent parsing
4. WHEN processing batch operations THEN the workflow SHALL handle multiple entities in a single execution
5. WHEN generating advice THEN the workflow SHALL route to the conversational advice node
6. WHEN updating memories THEN the workflow SHALL automatically update interaction timestamps

### Requirement 7: Interaction History Tracking

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to automatically track when I interact with contacts, so that reconnection suggestions are based on accurate, up-to-date information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I add a memory for a contact THEN the system SHALL update that contact's last talked date to today
2. WHEN I create a new contact THEN the system SHALL set the last talked date to today if not specified
3. WHEN calculating reconnection suggestions THEN the system SHALL use the most recent last talked date
4. WHEN displaying contact information THEN the system SHALL show how many days since last interaction
5. WHEN a contact has never been interacted with THEN the system SHALL use the contact creation date as baseline

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Validation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully during batch operations and proactive checks, so that one failure doesn't break the entire workflow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN batch processing encounters invalid data THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue with valid entries
2. WHEN proactive checking fails THEN the system SHALL continue with normal operation and log the issue
3. WHEN advice generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide a fallback response acknowledging the limitation
4. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages to the user
5. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL specify which fields are invalid and why
