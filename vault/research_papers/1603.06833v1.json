Keywords : residue current, Bochner–Martinelli form, Mellin transf orm. 1 Introduction Let us consider a residue current of the Bochner–Martinelli type a ssociated with a holomorphic mapping f= (f1,...,f p) :V→Cp, (1) whereVis some domain in Cnandp∈ {1,...,n}. Such a current was deﬁned by M. Passare, A. Tsikh and A. Yger in [10] as a limit Tf(ϕ) = lim η→0cp∫display /bardblf/bardbl2=ηΩ(f)∧ϕ, (2) where the kernel Ω( f) is given by Ω(f) =1 /bardblf/bardbl2pp∑ k=1(−1)k−1fk/logicalanddisplay l/\\e}atio\\slash=kdfl, the test form ϕwith bidegree ( n,n−p) is smooth and compactly supported in V (ϕ∈ Dn,n−p(V)) andcp=(−1)p(p−1)/2(p−1)!

The integration set in (3) is the real analytic chain (tube) Tε(f) ={|f1|2=ε1,...,|fp|2=εp}, ∗The research was carried out in Siberian Federal University within the framework of the project, funded by the grant of the Russian Federation Government to support scien tiﬁc research under supervision of a leading scientist, no. 14.Y26.31.0006.

Theorem 1.1 in [10] states that limit (2) always exists and deﬁnes a (0 ,p)–current. In the complete intersection case, when the set f−1(0) has codimension p, the current Tfcoincides with the Coleﬀ–Herrera current (see [10, 5]) and with currents con sidered in papers [7], [8], [4]. The advantage of this approach is caused by the fact that the integral in (2) depends on one parameter ηinstead ofpparameters ε1,...,ε pin (3). The concept of the Bochner-Martinelli residue currents has been considerably developed by M. Andersson, E. Wulcan and other authors; see, fo r example [2, 14], for more details. The structural formula for the Bochner–Martin elli residue current RzAassociatedwiththemonomial ideal( zA)ofzerodimension, A⊂Zn +, wasstudied in [14]. In particular, a description of the annihilator ideal Ann RzAin terms of the associated Newton diagram was given. Our goal is to study the structure of the Bochner–Martinelli resid ue current in the normal crossing case, when fjin (1) are monomials. Theorem 1 claims that the current associated with the system of pmonomials in nvariables may be represented as the sum of products of residue currents, princip al value currents and hypergeometric functions. Essentially, we are interested in the ca se when 1<p<n. For the case p= 1 the problem was studied by P. Dolbeault in [6]. The Bochner– Martinelli current for a monomial ideal, generated by nmonomials (i.e. in the case p=n), was calculated in [10]. In the present paper we treat ideas propos ed in [10] in general monomial case. We focus on the demonstration of the Me llin transform technique (see [3]) and residue theory methods that have been pro ven in the theory of residue currents (see [8, 12]). Letusremindthatforaholomorphicfunction f:V→Cinsomedomain V⊂Cn the principal value of 1 /f, determined by the limit /a\\}bracketle{t[1/f],ψ/a\\}bracketri}ht= lim ε→0∫display {|f|2>ε}ψ f, deﬁnes a current for ψ∈ Dn,n(V) (see [5]).

In particular, when n= 1 andf=zkis a monomial, one has /angbracketleftbig¯∂/bracketleftbig 1/zk/bracketrightbig ,ϕ/angbracketrightbig =2πi (k−1)!∂k−1 ∂zk−1˜ϕ(0), whereϕ= ˜ϕ(z)dz. 2 Role of the Mellin Transform Rewrite the integral in (2) in the form J(η) =J(η,ϕ) =cp ηp∫display /bardblf/bardbl2=η(gp∑ k=1(−1)k−1fk/logicalanddisplay l/\\e}atio\\slash=kdfl)g ∧ϕ, 2\nwhereϕis a test form from the space Dn,n−p(V). Its Mellin transform M[J(η)](ϕ,s) :=s+∞∫display 0J(η)ηs−1dη (4) is a holomorphic function in the half-plane ℜs>p. According to [10] it is holomor- phic across the imaginary axis and can be meromorphically continued t o the whole complex plane. Moreover, the map Dn,n−p∋ϕ/mapsto→M[J(η)](ϕ,0) gives the value of the current TfonV. This current can be realized also as the following limit of solid volume integrals Tf(ϕ) = lim τ→0+pcp∫display Vτ/logicalandtextp k=1dfk∧ϕ ( /bardblf/bardbl2+τ)p+1. (5) One can say that (5) is a regularization for Tf, since the integrand here is a regular diﬀerential form for any τ >0. Using representation (5), let us display the role of the Mellin transform of residue integral (3) in realization of the curr entTf(ϕ). To outline the idea we take p= 1. Applying the Mellin transform inversion formula for the functionτ (|f|2+τ)2=:F(τ), we obtain the following Mellin–Barnes representation F(τ) =1 2πiγ+i∞∫display γ−i∞Γ(s+1)Γ(1−s)|f|2(s−1)τ−sds,0<γ <1. (6) After substitution of the expression (6) in to integral (5) we get b y Fubini’s theorem the following representation: Tf(ϕ) = lim τ→0+1 2πiγ+i∞∫display γ−i∞Γ(s+1)Γ(1−s)Γf(s,ϕ)τ−sds,0<γ <1,(7) where Γf(s,ϕ) =1 2πi∫display V|f|2(s−1)df∧ϕ. The Γ f(s,ϕ) is equal to the Mellin transform +∞∫display 0I(ε,ϕ)εs−1dε of the residue function I(ε,ϕ) =1 2πi∫display |f|2=εϕ f. A multidimensional analog of formula (7) (see below (10)) was obtaine d in [13] in the complete intersection case. In fact, this hypothesis is not ne cessary, as it was proved in [10]. 3\nSo, now we deal with the Mellin transform of residue function (3) whic h is given by the integral s/mapsto→Γf(s,ϕ) =∫display Rp +I(ε,ϕ)εs−Idε, (8) wheres= (s1,...,s p)∈Cpandεs−Idε:=εs1−1 1·...·εsp−1 pdε1∧...∧dεp.It admits a representation as the following solid volume integral Γf(s,ϕ) =cp (p−1)!∫display Vp∏ k=1|fk|2(sk−1)p/logicalanddisplay k=1dfk∧ϕ. (9) Theorem 2.2 in [10] states that the current Tf(ϕ) can be given in terms of the function Γ f(s,ϕ) as follows Tf(ϕ) = lim τ→0+1 (2πi)p∫display γ+iRpτ−|s|Γ(|s|+1)p∏ k=1Γ(1−sk)Γf(s,ϕ)ds,(10) whereγ∈(0;1)pand|s|:=s1+...+sp. According to [8, Th. 2], the Mellin transform Γ f(s,ϕ) is holomorphic on the set{s∈Cp:ℜs∈Rp +}and it has a meromorphic continuation to all of Cp. In particular, for a monomial mapping ζA= (ζα1,...,ζαp) :Cn→Cp, (11) given by ap×n– matrixA, whose row vectors are αj∈Zn /greaterorequalslant, the Mellin transform ΓζA(s,ϕ) has simple poles on hypersurfaces /a\\}bracketle{tαk,s/a\\}bracketri}ht=−ν,ν∈N∪{0}, 1/lessorequalslantk/lessorequalslantn, whereαkdenote column vectors of the matrix A. Moreover, near the origin one has the following representation ΓζA(s,ϕ) =∑ ♯K=pcK /a\\}bracketle{tαk1,s/a\\}bracketri}ht·...·/a\\}bracketle{tαkp,s/a\\}bracketri}ht+Q(s) (12) with constants cK, whereK= (k1,...,k p) is an ordered set of indices, and Q(s) is a ﬁnite sum of functions with simple poles along fewer than phyperplanes. First of all, we clarify the view of integral (9) in the monomial case. Lemma 1. LetζAbe a monomial mapping. The Mellin transform ΓζA(s,ϕ)is equal to the sum∑ ♯I=pΓI ζA(s,ϕ) over all ordered sets I= (i1,...,i p),1/lessorequalslanti1< ... < i p/lessorequalslantn, whose summands ΓI ζA(s,ϕ)are deﬁned as follows cI∆I (2πi)p∫display CnϕI(ζ)/logicalanddisplay j∈I(g |ζj|2(/a\\}bracketle{tαj,s/a\\}bracketri}ht−1) ζ|αj|−1 jd¯ζj∧dζj)g/logicalanddisplay k/∈I(g |ζk|2/a\\}bracketle{tαk,s/a\\}bracketri}ht ζ|αk| kd¯ζk∧dζk)g .(13) In (13)∆Idenotes a minor of the matrix A,|αj|=αj 1+...+αj pis the sum of j,th column vector entries, ϕI(ζ)is a coeﬃcient of the test form ϕ=∑text IϕIdζ∧d¯ζ[I]and cI= (−1)|I|−(p+1)p/2+(n−p+1)(n−p)/2. 4\nProof.Let us remark that p∏ k=1|ζαk|2(sk−1)=n∏ k=1( |ζk|2)/a\\}bracketle{tαk,s/a\\}bracketri}ht−|αk|, (14) p/logicalanddisplay k=1dζαk=¯ζα1·...·¯ζαp∑ ♯I=p∆Id¯ζI ¯ζI, (15) where¯ζI=¯ζi1·...·¯ζip,d¯ζI=d¯ζi1∧...∧d¯ζipand ∆ I= detAI,AI= (αj),j∈I. We insert expressions (14), (15) in to integral (9), whose elementar y transformations complete the proof. Lemma 1 and formula (10) imply that the current TζAis equal to the sum TζA(ϕ) =∑ ♯I=pTI ζA(ϕ), whose summands can be represented as follows: TI ζA(ϕ) = lim τ→0+1 (2πi)p∫display γ+iRpτ−|s|Γ(|s|+1)p∏ k=1Γ(1−sk)ΓI ζA(s,ϕ)ds.(16) In fact, the set of admissible values for γin (16) may be enlarged to the set M=( intKI) ∩{x∈Rp:x1<1,...,x p<1}, whereintKIdenotes the interior of the cone KIwhose deﬁnition is given in (18) below. 3 Structure Theorem We consider the Bochner–Martinelli residue current, correspond ing to the system of monomials (11). Let us remind that αjis thej’th vector column of the matrix A and|αj|denotes the sum of its entries. From Lemma 1 it follows that the Mellin transform Γ ζA(s,ϕ) is equal to the sum of functions ΓI ζA(s,ϕ), each of which is represented by integral (13). Let us ﬁx a set I= (i1,...,i p). The corresponding function ΓI ζA(s,ϕ) has poles on pfamilies of hyperplanes /a\\}bracketle{tαk,s/a\\}bracketri}ht=−ν, ν∈N∪{0}, k∈I, (17) (see [8]). In the space Rpwith variables xj=ℜsjwe introduce the cone KI={x∈Rp:/angbracketleftbig αk,x/angbracketrightbig /greaterorequalslant0, k∈I} (18) and the intersection KI 0=KI∩Π/lessorequalslant of this cone with the half-space Π/lessorequalslant:={x∈Rp:x1+···+xp/lessorequalslant0}. Denote byq=q(I) the codimension of the cone KI 0. It follows that KI 0admits the representation KI 0={x∈Rp:/angbracketleftbig αj,x/angbracketrightbig = 0, j∈J,/angbracketleftbig αk,x/angbracketrightbig /greaterorequalslant0, k∈I\\J}, whereJ=J(I) is a subset of Ithe cardinality q. Ifq= 0, then the set KI 0contains interior points of the half–space Π /lessorequalslant. Ifq/greaterorequalslant1, thenKI 0is a (p−q)–dimensional face of the cone KI, lying on the boundary of the set Π /lessorequalslant. 5\nTheorem 1. The Bochner-Martinelli residue current TζA, associated with the map- pingζA, admits the representation TζA=∑ ♯I=pTI ζA, where TI ζA=cI/logicalanddisplay j∈J¯∂/bracketleftBigg 1 ζ|αj| j/bracketrightBigg/logicalanddisplay k∈I\\J(g 1 ζ|αk| kd¯ζk ¯ζk)g/logicalanddisplay l/∈I/bracketleftBigg 1 ζ|αl| l/bracketrightBigg F(|ζ1|2,..[J]..,|ζn|2).(19) TheF(|ζ1|2,..[J]..,|ζn|2)is a hypergeometric function (whose Mellin–Barnes integra l representation is given in formula (30) below) and the const antcIis deﬁned in Lemma 1. In particular, if J=I, then TI ζA=cI/logicalanddisplay j∈I¯∂/bracketleftBigg 1 ζ|αj| j/bracketrightBigg/logicalanddisplay l/∈I/bracketleftBigg 1 ζ|αl| l/bracketrightBigg . Remark 1. The support of the current TI ζAhas complex codimension q(I). 4 Leray Residue Form Toproverepresentation(19)weneedtodecreasethenumber of integrationsandtake the limit in (16). It is achieved by calculations of the composite residue form of the integrand in (16). The existence of the residue form for a given clos ed regular form was proved by Leray. Let us remind the deﬁnition of it (see [1, Ch. I II]). LetL⊂Cn be a complex analytic submanifold of dimension n−1 given in some neighborhood of a pointa∈Lby the equation λ(z) = 0, where λ(z) is a holomorphic function. Suppose that ψ(z) isa closed regular formon Cn\\Lthat hason Lapolar singularity of the ﬁrst order. It means that the form ψ(z)λ(z) extends to some neighborhood ofa∈Las aC∞–form. Then in some neighborhood Uaofa∈Lthere exist regular formsχ(z),θ(z) such that in Ua ψ(z) =dλ(z) λ(z)∧χ(z)+θ(z). (20) Theclosedformon Ldeﬁnedinaneighborhoodofeachpoint a∈Lbytherestriction χ(z)|Lis called the residue form of the form ψand denoted by res[ ψ]. For instance, if L={z∈Cn:λ(z) = 0}and ψ(z) =f(z) λ(z)dz1∧...∧dzn, where functions f(z),λ(z) are holomorphic in Cnand gradλ(z)|L/\\e}atio\\slash= 0, then res[ψ] = (−1)j−1f(z) λ′ zj(z)/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle/vextendsingle Ldz1∧..[j]..∧dzn in points where λ′ zj(z)/\\e}atio\\slash= 0. Let us consider complex analytic ( n−1)–dimensional submanifolds L1,...,L q⊂ Cnwhich intersect in common points transversally. It means that in som e neigh- borhood of a common point aholomorphic functions deﬁning locally submanifolds 6\nL1,...,Lqhave linearly independent gradients. If the closed form ψ(z) has simple poles on submanifolds L1,...,L q, then repeated application of (20) enables us to deﬁne the form resq[ψ] = res q◦...◦res1[ψ], called the composite residue form. We remark that if ψ=dλ1∧...∧dλq∧χ λ1·...·λq then resq[ψ] =χ|L1∩...∩Lq, whereλj=λj(z) are holomorphic functions deﬁning locally submanifolds Lj,j= 1,...,q, gradλj|L1∩...∩Lq/\\e}atio\\slash= 0. Let us consider integral (16) whose integrand we denote by ωI τ(s). If we choose γin the set Π /lessorequalslant, i.e.|γ|=γ1+...+γp<0, then ∫display γ+iRpωI τ(s)→0, τ→0+, since the form ωI τ(s) contains the factor τ−|s|. Having in mind this fact we can distinguish polar hyperplanes Lj={s∈Cp:/a\\}bracketle{tαj,s/a\\}bracketri}ht= 0}, j∈J= (j1,...,j q), of the form ωI τ(s) with respect to whose we are able to compute the residue form resLq/bracketleftbig ωI τ(s)/bracketrightbig , whereLq:=∈tersectiontext j∈JLj,ℜ(Lq)⊃KI 0. Letq= 1, thenL1=Lj1. We consider the ray l=γ+{/a\\}bracketle{tαj1,x/a\\}bracketri}ht/lessorequalslant0,/a\\}bracketle{tαj,x/a\\}bracketri}ht= 0, j∈I,j/\\e}atio\\slash=j1}, intersecting the set ℜL1in the point γ1. For any points γandκofllying on diﬀerent sides of γ1, the Cauchy formula yields the following equality ∫display γ+iRpωI τ(s) =∫display κ+iRpωI τ(s)+2πi∫display γ1+iℑL1resL1/bracketleftbig ωI τ(s)/bracketrightbig . (21) Ifκ∈Π/lessorequalslant, then the ﬁrst integral in (21) tends to zero as τ→0+. The second one in the right hand side has the same structure as the integral in the le ft-hand side, but in subspace Lj1. Havingq >1, we repeat q−1 times again residue theorem. As a result, we obtain the identity ∫display γ+iRpωI τ(s) = (2πi)qlim τ→0+∫display γq+iℑLqresLq/bracketleftbig ωI τ(s)/bracketrightbig +o(τ), whereγq∈ ℜLq. The setLq⊂ {s:|s|= 0}, hence resLq/bracketleftbig ωI τ(s)/bracketrightbig =p∏ j=1Γ(1−sj)resLq/bracketleftbig ΓI ζA(s,ϕ)ds/bracketrightbig . Therefore, we have the following statement which was proved in [10] forp=n. 7\nLemma 2. The limit of the p–fold integral (16) may be written as the (p−q)–fold integral TI ζA(ϕ) =1 (2πi)p−q∫display γq+iℑLqp∏ j=1Γ(1−sj)resLq/bracketleftbig ΓI ζA(s,ϕ)ds/bracketrightbig , (22) whereγq∈Mq:=rel int(KI 0∩M). So, we need to compute the residue of the form ΓI ζA(s,ϕ)ds, where the function ΓI ζA(s,ϕ) is given by integral (13). For that let us introduce new coordinate sλ= (λj) =sA,λj=/a\\}bracketle{tαj,s/a\\}bracketri}ht,j= 1,...,n. LettingAIdenote the square matrix, whose column vectors are αj,j∈I, we thus get sAI=λI, s=λIA−1 I, whereλI= (λi1,...,λ ip), ∆I= detAI/\\e}atio\\slash= 0. If ∆ I= 0, then ΓI ζA(s,ϕ) = 0. Integral (13) in coordinates λIlooks as follows: cI∆I (2πi)p∫display CnϕI(ζ)/logicalanddisplay j∈I(g |ζj|2(λj−1) ζ|αj|−1 jd¯ζj∧dζj)g/logicalanddisplay k/∈I(g |ζk|2/a\\}bracketle{tλI,µk/a\\}bracketri}ht ζ|αk| kd¯ζk∧dζk)g ,(23) where µk=p∑ l=1αk lβl andβlis thel’th column vector of the inverse matrix A−1 I. Nowletperformtheintegrationin(23)withrespecttovariables ζJ= (ζj1,...,ζ jq) using polar coordinates. To this end for the smooth function ϕI(ζ) :Cn→Cand α= (|αj1|−1,...,|αjq|−1)∈Nqwe consider a decomposition of the type ϕI(ζ) =∑ j∈J∑ k+l<|αj|−1ψj kl(ζ[j])ζk j¯ζl j+∑ K+L=αψKL(ζ)ζK J¯ζL J, (24) where all the coeﬃcient functions are smooth and the ψj klare independent of the variableζj, see [8]. Decomposition (24) is a result of the Taylor expansion for th e functionϕI(ζ) at the origin with respect to variables ζJ= (ζj1,...,ζ jq). Introducing polar coordinates ζj=rjeiθj,j∈J, in (23) and using (24) we get two series of inner integrals 2π∫display 0ei(k−l+1−|αj|)θjdθj, (25) and 2π∫display 0ei(Kj−Lj+1−|αj|)θjdθj. (26) Integrals (25) are all equal to zero, since k−l/greaterorequalslantk+l<|αj|−1. In series (26) the only one integral is nonzero when Lj= 0,Kj=|αj|−1. Moreover, remind that the test formϕhas compact support, so, in fact, we integrate with respect to a v ariable rjover a segment [0; Rj]. 8\nAs a result of integration in (23) with respect to variables ζJ= (ζj1,...,ζ jq), we have the following representation ΓI ζA=cI∆I (2πi)p−q1 λj1...λjq  ∫display Cn−qϕα I(ζ[J])/logicalanddisplay j∈I\\J(g |ζj|2λj ζ|αj| jd¯ζj ¯ζj∧dζj)g /logicalanddisplay k/∈I(g |ζk|2/a\\}bracketle{tλI,µk/a\\}bracketri}ht ζ|αk| kd¯ζk∧dζk)g +˜Q(λI)/bracerightBigg ,(27) where ϕα I(ζ[J]) =1 (|αj1|−1)!...(|αjq|−1)!∂|αj1|+···+|αjq|−q ∂ζ|αj1|−1 1...∂ζ|αjq|−1 qϕI(0J,ζ[J]), ζ[J] = (ζ1,..[J]..,ζn) and˜Q(λI) is a holomorphic function in a neighborhood of the origin, belonging to the ideal/angbracketleftbig λj1,...,λ jq/angbracketrightbig . The form ΓI ζAdsin new coordinates λImay be written as follows: ΓI ζAds=/logicalanddisplay j∈Jdλj λj∧(R(λI)dλI[J])+Q(λI), (28) whereλI[J] = (λi1,..[J]..,λip),dλI[J] =dλi1∧..[J]..∧dλip,Q(λI) is a meromorphic p–form, which has poles on r < qcoordinate hyperplanes. The restriction of the formR(λI)dλI[J] on the set Lqgives the residue form that we need: resLq/bracketleftbig ΓI ζAds/bracketrightbig =R(0J,λI[J])dλI[J], (29) where R(0J,λI[J]) =cI (2πi)p−q∫display Cn−qϕα I(ζ[J]) /logicalanddisplay j∈I\\J|ζj|2λj ζ|αj| jd¯ζj ¯ζj∧dζj /logicalanddisplay (g/logicalanddisplay k/∈I|ζk|2/a\\}bracketle{tλI[J],µk[J]/a\\}bracketri}ht ζ|αk| kd¯ζk∧dζk)g , andµk[J] means that coordinates µk j,j∈J, inµkare removed. 5 Proof of Theorem 1 We have now collected almost all elements for the proof of Theorem 1 . Ifq= 0, thenTI ζA= 0. In this case dim RKI 0=pand we can choose γin the setMso that |γ|=γ1+···+γp<0. Consequently, the restriction of the integrand in (16) to γ+iRptends to zero as τ→0+, and hence, TI ζA= 0. Assuming that q/greaterorequalslant1, we apply Lemma 2. The set Lqadmits the following parametrization: sl=∑ j∈I\\Jβl jλj, l= 1,...,p. Substituting the residue form (29) into formula (22) and applying Fu bini’s theorem, we can observe the structure of the residue current TI ζA(ϕ). It admits the following 9\nrepresentation: cI (2πi)p−q∫display Cn−qϕα I(ζ[J])/logicalanddisplay j∈I\\J(g 1 ζ|αj| jd¯ζj ¯ζj∧dζj)g × /logicalanddisplay k/∈I(g 1 ζ|αk| kd¯ζk∧dζk)g F(|ζ1|2,..[J]..,|ζn|2), wherethefunction F(|ζ1|2,..[J]..,|ζn|2)isrepresentableastheMellin–Barnesintegral 1 (2πi)p−q∫display iRp−qp∏ l=1Γ 1−∑ j∈I\\Jβl jλj ∏ j∈I\\J(g |ζj|2∏ k/∈I|ζk|2/a\\}bracketle{tαk,βj/a\\}bracketri}ht)gλj dλI[J],(30) whereβjis thej’th row of the matrix A−1 I. IfJ=I, then the integration set in (22) is zero-dimensional, so the curren t TI ζA(ϕ) admits the following representation cI∫display Cn−pϕα I(ζ[I])/logicalanddisplay k/∈I(g 1 ζ|αk| kd¯ζk∧dζk)g =cI/logicalanddisplay j∈I¯∂/bracketleftBigg 1 ζ|αj| j/bracketrightBigg/logicalanddisplay k/∈I/bracketleftBigg 1 ζ|αk| k/bracketrightBigg .
