DeTi kZifycan leverage all graphics programs for training but lacks text guidance, while AutomaTi kZis constrained to the small intersection of captioned graphics programs, resulting in limited performance. Our approach, TikZero, trains indepen- dently onboth graphics programsand captioned images, enabling more effective use of available data and yielding superior results. end text-guided models like AutomaTi kZrequire graphics programs pairedwith captions, substantially reducing the available data pool (cf. Fig. 2).

Related Work Inverse Graphics Program Synthesis Inverse graphics, i.e.,synthesizingagraphicsprogramtoreproduceavisual target, represents a specialized instance of neural program synthesis [ 9–11]. Deep learning models have shown remark- able success in this domain [ 12–14], with Vision-Language Models ( VLMs) increasingly gaining prominence [ 2,15– 17]. While controlled experimental studies often rely on synthetic datasets [ 13,15,17–20], real-world applications typically leverage more complex and diverse human-created data [2,21–25], highlighting the importance of data avail- ability. In scientific contexts, Ti kZ has emerged as a popular choice due to its versatility, expressiveness, and widespread adoption in academic circles [ 2,21–23,25]. Although these approaches are not tailored to text-guided generation, we incorporate key elements from them into our approach. Text-Guided Graphics Program Synthesis Current text- guided approaches to graphics program synthesis remain limited,mainlybecauseofthescarcityofcaptionedgraphics programsoutlinedinSec.1,butalsobecauseofthedifficulty of generating synthetic data with human-like captions [ 26, 27]. Researchersinterestedinthiscapabilitycurrentlyrelyon theemergingcapabilitiesoflargecommercialmodelssuchas GPT-4o[8,28–30],whichraisesconcernsaboutaccessibility, reproducibility, and computational cost [ 31]. In contrast, related domains like vector graphics generation [ 24,32–35] andNL2Vis[36–40] have shown more progress. Similar to inverse graphics, these fields increasingly incorporate large language models ( LLMs) [24,36,40]. However, vector graphicsapproachestypicallygenerateonlylow-levelBézier curves,limitingoutputcomplexity[ 2,32,33],and NL2Vis focusesexclusivelyondatavisualizationwitharestrictedset ofvisualizationtypes[ 40]. Morecomplexapplications,such asgeneratingarbitraryscientificfiguresfromcaptionswith TikZ, remain underexplored—a gap we address in this work. Text-to-Image Generation TikZeroshares conceptual and architectural similarities with several text-to-image gen- erationmethods[ 41–45]. Rodriguezetal. [46,47]explore generative adversarial networks [48, 49] and diffusion mod- els [50,51] for scientific figure generation, but these ap- proaches are tied to raster images, which are not ideal for representing scientific figures. Ramesh et al. [43]propose a two-stagemodelwithindependentlytrainedprioranddecoder componentstogeneraterasterimagesfromtext. Although priornetworksresembleouradaptersandhavebeenusedwith inversegraphicsmodels[ 52],theytarget globalimageembed- dings containing only abstract information, which degrades performance whenused withinversegraphics architectures that workbest with patch-level details [53]. Incontrast, our adapters specifically operate on patch-level embeddings, and we demonstrate that this improves performance compared to end-to-end trained baselines. 2\nTikZero Adapter Network Text Encoder Self-Attn𝑁... ...

Figure3illustratesits innerworkings(dashedlines): themodelprocessesrasterized imagesandautoregressivelygeneratestheircorresponding programs without involving captions at this stage. The Adapter Network VLMsconsistoftwoprimarycom- ponents: a vision encoder that produces image embeddings andatextdecoderthat,inourcase,generatesgraphicspro- grams conditioned on these embeddings. The unidirectional andlocalizedflowofinformationbetweenthesecomponents allows us to inject additional information solely into the vision encoder, thereby influencing the output of the text decoder. We exploit this property by introducing a trainable, text-conditioned adapter network that mimics the outputs of theoriginalvisionencoder. Thiseffectivelyenableszero-shot generationofgraphicsprogramsconditionedontextwhenits outputsarefedintothedecoder. Inadditiontocircumventing the resource limitations discussed in Sec. 1, this architecture has other welcome implications: During adapter training, the text decoder, usually the largest component of the model, does not need to be loaded, resulting in efficient and fast training even with large datasets. Our adapter incorporates a lightweighttextencoderforembeddingcaptionsandintro-ducesnewly initializedgatedcross-attentionlayers [ 56,57] beforeeachvisionencoderlayer(cf.,Fig.3). Thekeysand values derive from the final text encoder representations, while the queries originate from a trainable probe used in- stead of image inputs. The gates 𝛾allow the model to learn at which layers and to what extent information from the text encoder should flow into the vision encoder. Contrary to existing literature, which often employs tanhgates [58] that initialize to zero (indicating no information flow), we find that using sigmoidgates (0.5 at initialization) accelerates trainingconvergencesince,inourcase,onlylittleinformation originates from the vision encoder inputs (i.e., the probe). We ablate the gates and the probe in Appendix A. Training Objective Given a caption-image dataset for training,wefirstembedthepatches 𝑝∈𝒑ofimage𝑖using theunmodifiedvisionencoder Mofour VLM.Subsequently, we incorporate the cross-attention adapter to obtain the modified encoder bM, which we then distill on these image patch embeddings conditioned solely on the caption 𝑡and probe ˆ𝚤[59]. This leads to the following objective: Ldist=1 |𝒑|∑︁ 𝑝∈𝒑dist\u0010 M𝜃(𝑝|𝑖),bM𝜃,ˆ𝜃(𝑝|ˆ𝚤,𝑡)\u0011 ,(1) where dist(𝒙,𝒚)represents a distance metric.

Datasets & Model Training We introduce DaTi kZv3, a novel dataset of Ti kZ graphics programs designed to support the training and evaluation of TikZero. Additionally,wetrain AutomaTi kZv2asadirectly comparable baseline operating on the same data source. TheDaTi kZv3Dataset DaTi kZv3expandsuponitspre- decessors DaTi kZandDaTi kZv2[2,3], incorporating programsfromcuratedrepositories,T EX.SE,arXivpapers, andartificialsamples(cf.Tab.1). Whilepreviousversions focused exclusively on Ti kZ graphics with (v1) or without (v2) captions, DaTi kZv3systematically extracts captions alongside Ti kZ graphics whenever possible to support our claims. Fromover450kinstances,fewerthan170kinclude captions, underscoring the challenges discussed in Sec. 1. Training TikZero TikZero’sVLMbuilds upon De- TikZify[2] by conditioning a LLaMA-based text de- coder [62] on patch embeddings from a SigLIPvision en- coder[63]. Specifically,wecombine LLaMA 3.1(8B)[57] with SigLIP SoViT (0.4B). Unlike DeTi kZifyand inspired by the continued ViTpretraining approach of InternVL 1.5[64],weinitializethevisionencoderwithweightsfrom the fine-tuned encoder of PaliGemma [65] and increase the input resolution to 420×420pixels. Furthermore, we fully fine-tune the vision encoder alongside the rest of the model instead of freezing it. We train on DaTi kZv3for 5 epochs witha learning rate of 5e−5and abatch size of 128. TikZero’sVLMconsistently outperforms DeTi kZify, with detailed evaluation results provided in Appendix B. For the adapter network, we initialize with LLaMA 3.2(1B) as the textencoder[ 57]andleverage ArxivCap [26],adatasetcom- prising6.4millionscientificcaption-imagepairsfortraining. The adapter accounts for 2 billion of TikZero’s 10 billion total parameters, with only 400 million being trainable. We trainfor3epochswithalearningrateof 1e−4andabatchsize of 512. We emphasize that this two-stage training process does notaccess caption-program pairs. However, we demon- strate that incorporating such aligned data in a subsequent fine-tuning step (Sec. 5.2) further enhances performance.Training AutomaTi kZv2Similartoitspredecessor, Au- tomaTi kZv2isatoken-conditioned LLMthatusestokenized captions as conditioning information for graphics prediction (rather than patch embeddings). We initialize Automa- TikZv2in two different ways: (i) AutomaTi kZv2(LLM), whichstartsfromvanilla LLaMA 3.1(8B)weights,and(ii) AutomaTi kZv2(VLM),which leverages TikZero’strained VLM(minus the vision encoder) to benefit from transfer learning [ 66] on its larger training corpus. Both variants employ the same hyperparameters as TikZero’sVLMbut canonlyutilizethecaption-annotatedsubsetof DaTi kZv3for training. Despite having access to less caption-aligned data thanTikZero’s adapter network, AutomaTi kZv2requires a longertrainingperiodprimarilyduetofine-tuningthelarge decoder (8 billion trainable parameters versus the adapter network’s 400 million). Training requires more than two days for AutomaTi kZv2and 1.5 days for TikZero’s adapter network when using eight Nvidia A100 40GB GPUs. 5. Experiments Before training models on DaTi kZv3, we extract 1k samples fromitscaptionedsubsettoformourtestset. Tomitigatedata leakagefrompretrainingtotesting,weonlyincludeinstances created after the cut-off date specified by LLaMA 3.2and ArxivCap . Wealsoemployan 𝑛-grammatchingalgorithm to avoid cross-contamination with our training split [ 8]. For all models, the temperature is set to 0.8 and top-p to 0.95. Example outputs are provided in Fig. 1 and Appendix F. Evaluation Metrics The multimodal nature of our task allowsforvariousevaluationmetricsinourautomaticeval- uations. We assess perceptual image similarity between generatedoutputsandreferencesbycomputing DreamSim (DSim)[67,68],whichcorrelateshighlywithhumanjudg- ments for scientific images [ 2]. We also calculate the Kernel Inception Distance ( KID) [69] using SigLIPimage fea- tures,whichevaluatestheoverallqualityofgeneratedfigures by comparing to the distribution of reference figures. We evaluatecaptionsimilarity betweengeneratedoutputsandref- erence captions using CLIPScore (CLIP) [70] with SigLIP features. To measure code similarity between generated and reference Ti kZ programs, we use CrystalBLEU (cBLEU), aBLEUvariant optimized for code evaluation [ 71,72], and TEX Edit Distance ( TED) [2], a variant of the Extended Edit Distance [ 73] utilizing a T EX tokenizer. Since some metrics require that generated programs compile to images, resamplingisnecessaryiftheoutput containsirrecoverable errors. To quantify this, we compute the Mean Token Effi- ciency(MTE),definedasthe10%winsorizedmeanofthe ratiobetweenthenumberoftokensinthefinalTi kZprogram and the total number of tokens generated to produce that program.

As these metrics operate on different scales, we apply min-max normalization before computing the average. Additionally, some metrics are recomputed with redacted text in the outputs as part of our analysis, cf. Sec. 6.1. 5.1. Comparison against End-to-End Fine-Tuning In our initial experiment, we evaluate the zero-shot perfor- manceof TikZero,trainedasdescribedinSecs.3&4using eithercosinedistance( Cos)ormeansquarederror( MSE), and compare it against end-to-end trained baselines. Baselines Besides AutomaTi kZv2(LLM&VLM), which we designed as directly comparable baselines, we assess othertoken-conditionedmodelsofsimilarandslightlylarger sizestrainedonTi kZ.Specifically,weevaluate AutomaTi kZ (13B),3the strongest original AutomaTi kZbaseline [ 3], and thegeneral-purposechatbot IDEFICS 3 (8B)[22]. Additional models and details are available in Appendices A & C. Results Wepresentthesystem-levelmetricscoresinTab.2 (Original Text). On average, TikZero, trained with cosine distance,achievesthebestperformancewithanAVGscore of 85.599, closely followed by the MSEvariant at 85.004. The next best model, AutomaTi kZv2(LLM), scores 82.375, whichis3percentagepoints(pp)lower. Theremainingmod- elsexhibitasubstantialperformancegap,with IDEFICS 3 (8B)and AutomaTi kZ(13B)fallingbehindbyapproximately 20ppand AutomaTi kZv2(VLM)showingtheweakest per- formance across all metrics, resulting in an AVG score of 0. Thesurprisinglypoorresultsof AutomaTi kZv2(VLM) are likely due to catastrophic forgetting [ 74], as the removal of the vision encoder from TikZero’sVLMnecessitates reacquisition of conditioning based solely on text. Asforindividualmetrics,ouradapter-basedmodelsper- form particularly well in perceptual image similarity, with TikZero(Cos) outperforming the best baseline, Automa- TikZv2(LLM),by3ppon DreamSim . Although Automa- TikZv2(LLM) outperforms TikZeroby 1.5ppon KID, this 3Belouadi et al. [3] refer to this model as CLiMA(13B).indicates in this context that such token-conditioned models (compared to those using patch embeddings) capture the general appearance of scientific figures well but fall short in inferringvisualspecificsfromcaptions. Theydo,however, have an edge in reproducing text from captions, which we identify as the primary reason for up to 5pp higher CLIP- Score, as noted in Sec. 6.1. Regarding code similarity, both TikZeromodels considerably outperform others on cBLEU. Interestingly, we observe a mild inverse correlation between cBLEUandTED. Models conditioned solely on tokenized captions tend to generate shorter, often simplified programs [ 3], potentially resulting in a reduced edit distance to the reference. In terms of efficiency, all models achieve anMTEof80–85,indicatingthatonly2outof10inferences require resampling. TikZero(Cos) is 3pp more efficient thanMSE,while AutomaTi kZ(13B),likelybenefitingfrom its larger model size, exceeds it by another 3pp. In summary, training AutomaTi kZv2on top of a VLM yields worse performance than training based on vanilla LLaMA 3.1, indicating that effective end-to-end training can onlyleveragethesmallintersectionofgraphicsprogramsand images with captions, as illustrated in Fig. 2. However, even withoutaccesstothisintersection, TikZerosurpassesboth AutomaTi kZ(13B) and AutomaTi kZv2(LLM) on average bybeingabletotrainonimageswithcaptionsindependently ofgraphicsprograms. Moreover,usingalossfunctionbased on cosine distance proves more effective than using MSE. 5.2.

Baselines In addition to the baselines in Tab. 2, which remain comparable, we also evaluate larger and commercial models that serve as stronger baselines (cf. Appendix C). Specifically, we assess GPT-4o[8], which has demonstrated strong performance in generating Ti kZ [3,28,30] and Qwen 2.5Coder(32B) [75] as an open-weights model.

In summary, fine-tuning TikZero, especially when com-bined with a separate caption input and weight resetting, greatly improves performance. This illustrates that the in- tersection of graphics programs and images with captions, though small, provides a valuable training signal, and best performancecanbeachievedbymakingfulluseofbothsets. The best-performing TikZeromodel even competes with andoftensurpasses Qwen 2.5Coder(32B)and GPT-4oon several key metrics. Notably, the former model is more than three times larger, and the latter is often estimated at around 1.8 trillion parameters [76], making it 180 times larger. 5.3. Human Evaluation Tocorroborateourfindingsfromautomaticevaluation,we conduct ahuman annotationcampaign focusingon twokey properties: captionandimagesimilarity. Weemploy Best- Worst Scaling (BWS) [77], a comparative annotation method that yields high-quality results even with few annotators [ 78, 79]. Wesample100instancesfromourtestsetandpresent annotators with 𝑛-tuples of generated figures, asking them to identify the most and least similar figure to either the reference caption or reference image. This data is then transformed into scores from -1 (poor) to 1 (excellent) by subtracting the proportion of times a figure is selected as the best from the proportion of times it is chosen as the worst[80]. Foramanageableworkload,wefocuson 𝑛=4 key models: TikZero(Cos), our best-performing model from Sec. 5.1; AutomaTi kZv2(LLM), its direct end-to-end trained competitor; GPT-4o, our strongest baseline; and TikZero(Cos) fine-tuned using approach (iii) from Sec. 5.2, ourbestmodeloverall,henceforthreferredtoas TikZero +for convenience. Weengagethirteenannotatorsandobtainsix fullyannotatedsetspertask(cf.AppendixEformoredetails). Toassessannotatorconsistency,wecalculatethe split-half reliability (SHR) [79].

Analysis We present a comprehensive analysis, investigating the influ- enceoftypographicattackson CLIPScore andexamining the effectiveness of our architecture in low-resource settings, both in terms of training data and trainable parameters. 6.1.CLIPScore Limitations & Typographic Attacks Aknownlimitationof CLIPScore withtext-richimagesisits susceptibilitytotypographicattacks,wherescoresaredispro- portionately influencedby stringsimilarity between images and captions [ 3,43]. We suspect that token-conditioned models like AutomaTi kZv2(LLM) achieve higher CLIP- Scorevalues than models such as TikZero(Cos&MSE) primarily because they tend to visibly copy more substrings from the caption in the output image. To test this hypothesis, we apply the ROT13 substitution cipher [ 81] to all visible stringsinthegeneratedfiguresandrecompute CLIPScore . Thisbasiccipherreplaceseachletterwiththe13thletterafter it in the Latin alphabet. While not cryptographically secure, theratiobetweentheoriginalandrecomputed CLIPScore values shouldindicate theinfluence ofstring matching,i.e., higher ratios suggest less copied text and vice versa. Tabs.2&3(RedactedText)presenttherecomputed CLIP- Scorevaluesandratiosforallevaluatedmodels. Theresults revealthatmost TikZeromodels,exceptforfine-tuningap- proaches(ii)and(iii),whichalsoconditionontokenizedcap- tions, have considerably higher ratios (61%–78%) compared tostrictlytoken-conditionedmodels(34%–51%),supporting ourhypothesis. AutomaTi kZ(13B)isanexception,possibly due to its initially low score. Further analysis shows that withredactedtext, AutomaTi kZv2(LLM)’sCLIPScore per- formance drops to the same level as TikZero(Cos&MSE), suggesting that string matching is the primary factor in its superiorperformance ratherthanproducingbetter visuals— arguably a more difficult task. Nevertheless, reproducing strings is still somewhat desirable. The human oracle of ourtestsetachievesaratioof50.8%,closetothe47.5%of TikZero +,ourbest-performingmodel. Incontrast,models likeGPT-4o, with a lower ratio of 41.9%, may overfit to caption copying, artificially inflating the CLIPScore values. 6.2.

Along the same vein, we examine the im- pactofreducingtheamountofcross-attentionlayersinserted intothevisionencoder. Weretrain TikZero(Cos)usingvary- ingfractionsofthetrainingdata( 𝑑∈{1,1 2,1 4,1 8})andinsert cross-attentionlayersatdifferentintervals( 𝑖∈{1,2,4,8}). Table 4 presents the AVG scores from this parameter grid, with detailed scores in Appendix D. Our findings reveal that utilizingthefulldatasetandinsertingcross-attentionatevery layer yields the highest average performance, highlighting the benefits of maximizing both variables. Interestingly, the model’s performance appears more robust to a reduction in the number of layers compared to a decrease in training data. For instance, training on only1 8th of the data leads to a substantial performance drop of 36pp, whereas insert- ingcross-attentionlayersevery8layers(resultinginonly3 cross-attention layers in total) causes a more modest decline of 16pp. Minimizing both variables leads to the most severe dropofover75pp. Theseresultsvalidateourtrainingsetup while suggesting that incorporating additional data might furtherenhanceperformance. Giventhat ArxivCap extracts figures from only 572k papers, whereas some corpora index over 200 million papers [ 82], there remains a lot of potential for leveraging larger datasets in future work. 7. Conclusion Inthiswork,wedemonstratethepotentialof TikZeroandits variantsforgeneratingTi kZgraphicsprogramsfromcaptions. Notably, TikZerodoes not require aligned caption-program pairsinitsoriginalformulationbutinsteadalignsrepresenta- tion spaces of unaligned graphics programs and captioned images. This enables our model to leverage substantially moretrainingdatacomparedtoend-to-endtrainedmodels thatoperatesolelyoncaption-imagepairs(cf.Fig.2)while maintainingtrainingefficiency. TikZerooutperformsstrong end-to-end trained baselines, including our independently trained AutomaTi kZv2models, which use the same data pool,excludinginstancestheycannotprocess,illustratingthe strengths of our approach. When extending the TikZeroap-proach with additional end-to-end training, it also compares favorablytomuchlargerbaselinesandcommercialsystems likeGPT-4o. Whilethisenhancedapproach, TikZero +,is nolongerzero-shotbyourdefinition,itremainsa TikZero modelinthesensethatitoperatesonbothsetsofgraphics programsandcaptionedimages,withtheaddedadvantage of explicitly utilizing their intersection (cf. Fig. 2). These results demonstrate the benefits of designing archi- tecturesaroundavailabledataandvalidatetheapproachofde- coupling graphics program generation from text understand- ing (with optional later reconciliation through TikZero +). AlthoughwedemonstrateourmethodspecificallyonTi kZ, we believe its general principleswill inspire future work on related graphics program synthesis tasks. Future Work Beyond scaling up our training data to ex- ploreconvergencelimits(cf.Sec.6.2),weplantoinvestigate automatic methods for improving the quality and alignment of caption-image or caption-program pairs. This includes rewriting potentially noisy captions with LLMs and en- hancingthemwiththevisualunderstandingcapabilitiesof VLMs [83–85]. We believe our approach to aligning textual andimagemodalitiesenablesotherpromisingapplicationsfor graphics program synthesis, such as editing images in latent space viatextual instructionsto generatemodified graphics programs. Additionally, we intend to explore alternative alignment strategies beyond model distillation, including contrastive learning [ 86], which has successfully aligned modalities in discriminative models [6, 87, 88]. Limitations Our evaluations include proprietary systems that operate as black boxes; their training data is unknown, and they offer no guarantees of consistent performance over time. This (i)makesaddressingdataleakageandcross-contamination impossible and (ii) limits the fairness and reproducibility of ourexperiments. Nevertheless,evenundertheseunfavorable conditions, our open models remain competitive. Users should be aware, however, that our models may behave unpredictably, and outputs might differ from expectations. Additionally,ourmodelsdonotincludesafeguardsagainst potential misuse, e.g., for generating fake scientific content.

Additional Baselines and Ablation Studies Beyond the evaluation in Sec. 5, we test additional baselines, including reasoning models that have proven successful in program synthesis tasks [ 89]. We evaluate Qwen 2.5Coder (14B)[75],whichcomplements Qwen 2.5Coder(32B)from Sec.5.2,andreasoningmodelsfromthe DeepSeek-R1 Qwen family(14Band32B)[ 90]. Wealsoevaluate TikZero(Base), avariantof TikZero(Cos)withoutthetrainableprobeand gating mechanism, to assess their contributions. AsshowninTab.5, TikZero(Cos)achievesthehighest performance,surpassing TikZero(Base)onboth DreamSim andCLIPScore metrics and in average performance. These results validate the probe and gate design. Additionally, Qwen 2.5Coder(14B)performsworsethanboth TikZero (Cos) and, as expected, its 32B variant in Tab. 3. The results are consistent with our findings in Sec. 5.1 that TikZero(Cos) outperforms end-to-end trained baselines of comparable size. Notably, the reasoning models show thelowestoverallperformance,evencomparedto Qwen 2.5 Coder(14B), indicating that reasoning capabilities alone are insufficient for graphics program synthesis and more domain-specific post-training may be needed. B. Supplementary Comparison with DeTi kZify Tab.6showsindetailhow TikZero’sinversegraphicsmodel (hereafter referred to as DeTi kZify v2) compares against De- TikZify DS(7b),previouslythebestperforming DeTi kZify model, as evaluated on the test split of DaTi kZv3.De- TikZify v2clearly outperforms its predecessor across all evaluated metrics. Below, we briefly outline key differences intrainingandinferencebeyondwhatwedescribedinSec.4. For a comprehensive description of the foundation on which DeTi kZify v2builds, we refer to Belouadi et al. [2]. Training Similarto DeTi kZify,DeTi kZify v2employsa dense layer as the modality connector between the vision encoderandtextdecoder. However,forpretrainingthislayer, we replace the MetaFig dataset [2] with the substantially larger ArxivCap dataset,extracting1million(figure,caption, OCR)triplets. Duringfine-tuning,werandomlysubstitute inputs with synthetically generated sketches to support hand- drawn inputs. To generate these sketches, we fine-tune the image-editing model UltraEdit [91] on a dataset of real, human-createdscientificsketches[ 2]. Theresultingmodel, UltraSketch , achieves a congruence coefficient (CC) [ 92] of0.74withsaidsketches,comparedto0.72fortheprevious model used with DeTi kZify. Additionally, we generate synthetic sketches using traditional image transformations such as random displacement fields. While these sketches exhibit less diversity, they better preserve text rendering and achieve a comparable CC of 0.75. Averaging the sketch representations from both methods increases the CC to 0.82, demonstrating their complementary nature.Inference DeTi kZifyimplements a Monte Carlo Tree Search-based inference algorithm to iteratively refine out- puts. As a reward signal 𝑟, it computes the cosine similarity 𝑟cos=cos(pool(𝒙),pool(𝒚))between image patch embed- dings 𝒙,𝒚ofinputimagesandcompiledoutputsviaalearned pooling function. Since DeTi kZify v2fully fine-tunes the vi- sionencoderandusesitspatchembeddingsdirectly,itcannot compute pooled embeddings in the same way. As an alterna- tive,inspiredbypopularmachinetranslationmetrics[ 93–96], weexperimentwithcomputingtheEarthMover’sDistance (EMD) [97,98] with image patch embeddings. Given the distancematrix 𝑫,where𝐷𝑖,𝑗=cos(𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑗),EMDisdefined as follows: EMD(𝒙,𝒚)=Í|𝒙| 𝑖=1Í|𝒚| 𝑗=1𝐹𝑖,𝑗𝐷𝑖,𝑗 Í|𝒙| 𝑖=1Í|𝒚| 𝑗=1𝐹𝑖,𝑗, with min 𝑭≥0|𝒙|∑︁ 𝑖=1|𝒚|∑︁ 𝑗=1𝐹𝑖,𝑗𝐷𝑖,𝑗 s.t.∀𝑖,𝑗(Í|𝒙| 𝑖=1𝐹𝑖,𝑗=1 |𝒚|, Í|𝒚| 𝑗=1𝐹𝑖,𝑗=1 |𝒙|.(2) Whencorrelatingrewardscorescomputedas 𝑟cosfrom De- TikZifyand𝑟EMD=EMD(𝑥𝑖,𝑦𝑗)from DeTi kZify v2with human judgments from Belouadi et al. [2], we find that 𝑟EMDenhances correlation with humans (0.456 segment- level and 0.911 system-level Spearman’s 𝜌), compared to 𝑟cos(0.436and0.642, respectively). Thisdemonstratesthat DeTi kZify v2notonlysupportsthe inference algorithm but improves upon DeTi kZify’s capabilities. C.

The results show thatAutomaTi kZv2(LLM) and TikZero(Cos) are more frequentlyselectedastheworstmodels(fourandthreetimes, respectively),while TikZero +andGPT-4oaremoreoften chosen as the best models (both three times), which aligns with our findings in Sec. 5.3. Finally, Fig. 6 illustrates exam- ple programs generated by TikZero +andAutomaTi kZv2 (LLM),demonstratinghow TikZero +utilizesadvancedTi kZ features,whereas AutomaTi kZv2(LLM)employsonlybasic, simple commands. 5sourced from https://github.com/PetarV-/TikZ ,https:// github.com/janosh/tikz ,https://tikz.net ,and https://arxiv. org 16\n. . .

A transformer decoder (TD) is trained to produce a sequence of actions 𝑎𝑄 1,...,𝑎𝑄 𝑚 given a query instruction 𝐼𝑄. The context are demonstrations (𝐼𝑘,𝐴𝑘) produced by our generative model. We use a transformer encoder-decoder (T) to encode instructions and state 𝑆and a transformer encoder (TE) to encode actions. The transformers that process instructions (pink blocks) receive state𝑆as the input of the encoder. Figure 5.
