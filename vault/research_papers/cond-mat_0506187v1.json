Pershin and Carlo Piermarocchi Department of Physics and Astronomy, Michigan State Univer sity, East Lansing, Michigan 48824-2320 Persistent and radiation-induced currents in distorted na rrow quantum rings are theoretically investigated. We show that ring distorsions can be describe d using a geometrical potential term. We analyse the eﬀect of this term on the current induced by a ma gnetic ﬂux (persistent current) and by a polarized coherent electromagnetic ﬁeld (radiation-i nduced current). The strongest eﬀects in persistent currents are observed for distorted rings with a small number of electrons. The distortion smoothes the current oscillations as a function of the magne tic ﬂux and changes the temperature dependence of the current amplitude. For radiation-induce d currents, the distortion induces an ac component in the current and aﬀects its dependence on the rad iation frequency and intensity. PACS numbers: 73.23.Ra I. INTRODUCTION It is well known that a static magnetic ﬂux through a mesoscopic ring induces a dissipationless non-decaying (persistent) current at low temperature. During the last 20 years this persistent current has been heavily in- vestigated both from the theoretical and experimental side.1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20, 21,22In par- ticular, theoretical investigations were focused on the eﬀects of electron-electron interaction, disorder, spin- orbit,2polarized nuclear spins,3,4and shape.19,20More recently, the eﬀect of electromagnetic radiation on meso- scopic rings has been investigated. It has been pointed out that the persistent current can be strongly aﬀected by radiation21and also that radiation can induce a cur- rent at zero magnetic ﬂux.22,23In order to break the clockwise-anticlockwise symmetry and obtain a current at zero ﬂux a radiation with some degree of circular po- larizationisneeded. Thiscanbeachievedbyasuperposi- tion of pairs of time-asymmetric, linearly cross-polarized picosecond pulses,23or more simply by using circularly polarized radiation.22All these eﬀects were mainly stud- iedinsystemswithperfectringgeometry,i.e. ringswhere the conﬁnement potential does not depend on the az- imuthal coordinate. The only exceptions, to our knowl- edge, are Refs. 19 and 20, where the persistent current in an elliptical quantum ring19and the persistent cur- rent in a quantum ring on a surface of constant negative curvature20were considered. In this paper we investigate persistent and radiation- induced currents in distorted quantum rings. We con- sider a narrow distorted ring of uniform cross section ly- ing on a plane (Fig. 1). The ring can be composed by several segments of diﬀerent curvature or can have any smooth curvature proﬁle. We show that the curvature of the ringentersintothe Scr¨ odingerequationviaageomet- rical potential term of the form Vgeom=−/planckover2pi12/(8m∗R2), whereRis the radius of curvature. Our model diﬀers from the one used in Ref. 19, where a quantum ring of a non-uniform cross section was considered. By choosing a uniform cross section the eﬀect of the distorsion can be described in a simpler and more transparent way. Ourpaper is organized as follows. In Sect. II we derive the Schr¨ odinger equation for one electron in a distorted ring in the presence of a magnetic ﬂux. We show that, as in the ideal case, the wavefunction in the distorted ring is a periodic function of the magnetic ﬂux Φ with period Φ0. Next, in Sect. III, we consider a model where a dis- torted quantum ring consists of four constant-curvature segments. We ﬁnd the energy spectrum of such a ring and we demonstratethat the geometricalpotential Vgeom in this case opens gaps in the electron energy spectrum. Moreover, we show that the geometrical potential can lead to bound states. The oscillation of the persistent current, and the frequency and intensity dependence of the radiation-induced currents in the distorted ring are studied in Sec. IV. The results of our investigations are summarized in Sec. V. FIG. 1: (Color online) Distorted quantum ring consisting of a long segment of radius r1and three short segments of radius r2.\n2 II. EFFECTIVE HAMILTONIAN We consider one electron with eﬀective mass m∗con- ﬁned by a potential Vγ(γdenotes the characteristic width ofVγ) to a closed curve Con a plane. A uniform magnetic ﬁeld Hperpendicular to the plane is applied. The Schr¨ odinger equation has the form 1 2m∗( ˆ p−e cA)2 ψ+Vγψ=Eψ, (1) whereˆ pis the electron momentum operator and A(r) = 1 2[H,r] is the vector potential. Using the property div(A) = 0 of this gauge, Eq. (1) can be rewritten as 1 2m∗(g −/planckover2pi12∆−2e cAˆ p+e2 c2A2)g ψ+Vγψ=Eψ.(2) Our goal is to obtain an eﬀective one-dimensional Schr¨ odinger equation in the limit of a strong transverse conﬁnement, i.e. in the limit γ→0. We follow the approach proposed in Ref. 24 and subsequently used in Ref. 25. Let us introduce the orthonormal coordinate system (s,q), wheresis the arc length parameter and qis thecoordinate along the normal n(s). The curve Cis then described by a vector r(s) as a function of the arc length s. In a vicinity of Cthe position is therefore is described by R(s,q) =r(s)+qn(s). (3) For the sake of simplicity25we assume that Vγdepends only on the qcoordinate describing the displacement from the reference curve Conly. The Laplacian ∆ in the curvilinear coordinates sand qis given by ∆s,q=1 h∂ ∂s1 h∂ ∂s+1 h∂ ∂qh∂ ∂q, (4) with h= 1−k(s)q, (5) wherek(s) =R−1(s) is the curvature. Using the trans- formation to the new wave function χ(s,q) viaψ(s,q) = χ(s,q)/√ h(note, that χ(s,q) is properlynormalized), we can rewrite Eq. (2) as 1 2m∗/bracketleftbigg −/planckover2pi12(g∂ ∂s1 h2∂ ∂s−hss 2h3+5h2 s 4h4+∂2 ∂q2+k2 4h2)g + 2ie/planckover2pi1 c(g As(s,q)(g∂ ∂s+ksq 2h)g +Aq(s,q)(g∂ ∂q+k 2h)g)g +e2 c2A2/bracketrightbigg χ+Vγχ=Eχ , (6) wherehs=∂h/∂s,hss=∂2h/∂s2,ks=∂k/∂s, Aq(s,q) andAs(s,q) are the components of Aalong theqandsdirections. Next, we make the substitution χ= exp/bracketleftbigg ie /planckover2pi1cq∫text 0Aq(s,q′)dq′/bracketrightbigg ˜χ, and expand h,Aq(s,q), As(s,q) in series in qkeeping only the zero-order terms inq, as in Refs. 24,25. The Schr¨ odinger equation (6) can then be easily separated by setting ˜ χ(s,q) =ν(q)φ(s). The usual procedure yields −/planckover2pi12 2m∗∂2ν ∂q2+Vγν=Etν, (7) /bracketleftbigg −/planckover2pi12 2m∗∂2 ∂s2+ie/planckover2pi1 m∗cAs(s,0)∂ ∂s−/planckover2pi12k2 8m∗−ie/planckover2pi1 2m∗c× ∂Aq(s,0) ∂q+ie/planckover2pi1 m∗cAq(s,0)k 2+e2 2m∗c2A2 s(s,0)/bracketrightbigg φ=Elφ.(8) InordertofurthersimplifyEq.(8), weperformthetrans- formationφ(s) = exp/bracketleftbigg ie /planckover2pi1cs∫text 0As(s′,0)ds′/bracketrightbigg ˜φ(s), whichgives /bracketleftbigg −/planckover2pi12 2m∗∂2 ∂s2−/planckover2pi12k2 8m∗−ie/planckover2pi1 2m∗c∂As(s,0) ∂s− ie/planckover2pi1 2m∗ca1(s)+ie/planckover2pi1 m∗ca0k 2/bracketrightbigg ˜φ(s) =Et˜φ(s).(9) Notice that in the curvilinear coordinates ( s,q) the di- vergence of Ais given by divA=1 h∂ ∂s(g1 hAs)g +1 h∂ ∂q(hAq)≈ ∂ ∂sAs+∂ ∂qAq−kAq= 0.(10) Consequently, Eq. (9) reduces to −/planckover2pi12 2m∗∂2˜φ ∂s2−/planckover2pi12k2(s) 8m∗˜φ=El˜φ. (11) Therefore, we have derived two decoupled equations: one describing the transverse conﬁnement of electrons in the\n3 ring (Eq. (7)), and the second describing the longitudinal motion of the electron in the ring (Eq. (11)). The vector potential Adoes not explicitly appear in these two equa- tions. However it will appear in the solution of Eq. (11) because of the boundary conditions on ˜φspeciﬁed below. The spectrum of Eq. (7) depends on the particular shape of the conﬁnement potential Vγ. In this paper we assume that the electrons occupy only the lowest subband of the transversal conﬁnement. Therefore, the position of this energy subband is not important. The curvature of C enters into Eq. (11) through the geometrical potential term−/planckover2pi12k(s)2/8m∗. The boundary conditions for ˜φare obtained from the requirements of continuity of the wave function φ(s) and its derivative, i.e. φ(0) =φ(L),∂φ(0)/∂s=∂φ(L)/∂s (Lis the ring circumference). Using Stokes’ theorem we ﬁnally obtain ˜φ(0) =ei2πΦ Φ0˜φ(L),∂˜φ(0) ∂s=∂˜φ(L) ∂s.(12) Here Φ is the magnetic ﬂux through the area conﬁned by C and Φ 0is the magnetic ﬂux quantum. Eqs. (12) imply thatallequilibriumphysicalpropertiesofanarrowclosed loop are periodic in Φ with period Φ 0, as in the case of a perfect ring.8 III. ELECTRON ENERGY SPECTRUM In this section we consider the electron spectrum in a ring with a dent-type distortion as shown in Fig. 1. Geometrically, the curve C of such a ring consists of four smoothly connected circular segments. The radius of the long segment is r1, the three short segments have the sameradius r2(weassumeherethat r2<r1). Theangles αandβarerelatedto ϕ(for the deﬁnition ofthese angles see Fig. 1) as α= 2Arcsin[sin( ϕ/2)(r1−r2)/(2r2)],β= ϕ/2+α/2. The advantage of a distortion with constant curvature segments is a constant geometrical potential in each segment. The picture is even more simple since the geometrical potential does not depend on the direction of bending, i.e. Vgeomis the same for the three short segments in Fig. 1. Therefore, we write Eq. (11) for the long segment and three short segments as −/planckover2pi12 2m∗∂2φ1 ∂s2−U0φ1=Elφ1for 0<s<l, (13) −/planckover2pi12 2m∗∂2φ2 ∂s2=Elφ2forl<s<L, (14) wherel= (2β+α)r2is the total length of the short segments,L= (2π−ϕ)r1+l,U0=/planckover2pi12 8m∗(1/r2 2−1/r2 1). The general solution of Eqs. (13, 14) reads φ1=b1eik1s+b2e−ik1s, (15) φ2=c1eik2s+c2e−ik2s, (16) wherek1=/radicalBig 2m∗ /planckover2pi1(El+U0) andk2=/radicalBig 2m∗ /planckover2pi1El.

The calculated energy levels for weakly and strongly distorted rings as a function of the ﬂux are given in Fig. 2. It is well known that in perfect rings the energy levels are intersecting parabolas. In distorted rings, gaps are opened at the points of intersection of the parabo- las. This eﬀect is qualitatively similar to the eﬀect of disorder.8We emphasize that for a ﬁxed radius of distor- tion,thegapdecreasesforlargervaluesoftheintersection point energy. At a ﬁxed point of intersection, the gap in- creasesbydecreasingtheradiusofdistortion(i.e. thegap is larger in more distorted rings). Notice ﬁnally that due\n4 to the distortion the eﬀective circumference of the ring increases. Thisproducesnegativeshiftsoftheenergylev- els which are larger at higher energy. The qualitatively new feature of the spectrum is the presence of bound states with El<0. Similar bound states were already discussed in elliptical quantum rings.19It is interesting that the transition from unbound to bound states in the ringissmooth: theshallowboundstatesarestillsensitive to the magnetic ﬂux (Fig. 2, r2/r1= 0.25). In contrast, deep bound states have a weak sensitivity to the mag- netic ﬂux (Fig. 2, r2/r1= 0.17). Correspondingly, there is a ﬁnite contribution to the persistent current from the shallow bound states, while the contribution from the deep bound states is small. IV. EFFECT OF THE DISTORTION ON THE CURRENT A. Persistent currents induced by a magnetic ﬂux At non-zero temperature T, the current in the ring is given by I=−∂F ∂Φ. (19) Here, the free energy F=−kBT∑text nln( 1+expµ−En kBT) , kBis the Boltzman constant, and Tis the temperature. We consider a system with a ﬁxed number of spinless electronsN. The chemical potential µthat enters into F is determined by the equation ∑ n1 1+eEn−µ kBT=N. (20) In Fig. (3), we show the eﬀect of distortion on the persistent current in quantum rings with three electrons. These results were obtained numerically using Eqs. (20) and (19) with the energy spectrum determined from Eqs. (17) and (18). At zero temperature the persistent current oscillations in a perfect ring have a saw-tooth form. The distortion of the ring produces a smoothing of the oscillations due to the opening of energy gaps at the intersectionpoints. Fig. (3) showsthat the smoothingin- creases for larger distortions. Notice that the persistent current as a function of the magnetic ﬁeld ﬂux in the distorted ring at T= 0 looks similar to the persistent current in a perfect ring at T >0. The distortion of the ring changes the temperature de- pendence of the current amplitude. The temperature de- pendence of the persistent current and its amplitude in a perfect ring with a ﬁxed number of electrons at low tem- peratures was derived in26using a two-level approach.27 It was found that at low temperatures the persistent cur- rent can be written as26 I=2Nε Φ0/bracketleftbiggsinhγ 1+coshγ−2(gΦ Φ0−δ 2)g/bracketrightbigg ,(21) FIG. 3: (Color online) Persistent current in the ring at T= 0, ϕ=π/4,N= 3. Inset: temperature dependence of the persistent current amplitude in the perfect and distorted ( ϕ= π/4,r2/r1= 0.17) rings. kBTis in units of ε. whereγ=Nε(Φ/Φ0−δ/2)/(kBT),ε=/planckover2pi12/(2m∗r2), δ= 0 ifNis even and δ= 1 ifNis odd, and the overall factor two takes into account the spin degeneracy. The temperature dependence of the amplitude of the persis- tent current oscillations is given by Imax=2Nε Φ0(g/radicalbigg 1−4kBT Nε− 2kBT Nεarccosh/bracketleftbiggMε 2kBT−1/bracketrightbigg)g . (22) The comparison of the temperature dependence of the persistent current amplitude in the perfect and distorted rings is shown in the inset of Fig. 3. While the persistent current amplitude in the perfect ring starts to decrease atT= 0, the temperature dependence in the distorted ring shows an activation energy behavior in the vicinity ofT= 0 due to the gaps in the energy spectrum. In quantum rings with many electrons the main con- tribution to the persistent current is due to the electrons near the Fermi level. Since the energy gap disappears for large values of the intersection point energy, the per- sistent current at T= 0 will not be smoothed. Conse- quently, the persistent current in a distorted ring with a large number of electrons will be as in a perfect ring with a radiusr∗=L/(2π) in a weaker (for the case of a dent) magnetic ﬁeld B∗=BS/S∗, whereSis the area of the distorted ring and S∗= 2πr∗2. B. Current induced by circularly polarized radiation Inarecentpaper,22anovelmechanismforcurrentgen- eration in quantum rings was proposed. It was suggested\n5 that in the presence of a circularly-polarized continuous- wave (cw) radiation the light-dressed ground state of the ring is characterized by a non-zero current. The pur- pose of this Section is to study the inﬂuence of the ring distortion on this radiation-induced current. Let us consider an electron conﬁned in a distorted ring in the presence of circularly-polarized cw radiation. The single electron Hamiltonian in the dipole approximation reads H=H0+V(t) =−/planckover2pi12 2m∗∂2 ∂s2+Ugeom(s)+eE(t)r(s), (23) whereE(t) =E0cos(ωt)ˆx±E0cos(ωt)ˆxis the circularly- polarized electric ﬁeld, E0is its amplitude, and ±cor- responds to σ±radiation. The distorted quantum ring is considered again as made of four constant curvature segments, which allows us to use the energy spectrumand wave functions of H0obtained in Sec. III at Φ = 0. Assuming that the radiation frequency is close to the transition between the ground and two ﬁrst excited lev- els, we restrict our attention only to these three levels, with energies given by E0,E1andE2. The external radiation causes transitions between these levels. The electron dynamics in the ring can be conveniently described using the a density matrix ap- proach similar to the one used in Ref. 28 for quantum dots. The evolution of density matrix ρis given by i/planckover2pi1˙ρ= [H,ρ]−Γ{ρ}, (24) whereΓ{ρ}representsarelaxationterms. In therotating wave approximation the corresponding equations for the density matrix elements are ˙ρ00=v01−˜ρ10+v02−˜ρ20−˜ρ01v10+−˜ρ02v20++κ20ρ22+κ10ρ11, (25) ˙ρ11=v10+˜ρ01−˜ρ10v01−−κ10ρ11+κ21ρ22, (26) ˙ρ22=v20+˜ρ02−˜ρ20v02−−κ20ρ22−κ21ρ22, (27) ˙˜ρ01=E0−E1+/planckover2pi1ω i/planckover2pi1˜ρ01+v01−ρ11+v02−ρ21−ρ00v01−−γ01˜ρ01, (28) ˙˜ρ02=E0−E2+/planckover2pi1ω i/planckover2pi1˜ρ02+v01−ρ12+v02−ρ22−ρ00v02−−γ02˜ρ02, (29) ˙ρ12=E1−E2 i/planckover2pi1ρ12+v10+˜ρ02−˜ρ10v02−−γ12ρ12, (30) ˙˜ρ10=E1−E0−/planckover2pi1ω i/planckover2pi1˜ρ10+v10+ρ00−ρ11v10+−ρ12v20+−γ10˜ρ10, (31) ˙˜ρ20=E2−E0−/planckover2pi1ω i/planckover2pi1˜ρ20+v20+ρ00−ρ21v10+−ρ22v20+−γ20˜ρ20, (32) ˙ρ21=E2−E1 i/planckover2pi1ρ21+v20+˜ρ01−˜ρ20v01−−γ21ρ21.

(35) The persistent current is calculated using I= Tr/bracketleftBig ρˆj/bracketrightBig , whereˆjis the standard quantum mechanical current op- erator, and ρis the steady-state solution of Eqs. (25)- (33). We ﬁnd that in the distorted rings the currentoperator matrix has a form ˆj= 0 0j02 0 0j12 j20j120 , (36) withjij=j∗ ji. Correspondingly, the persistent current is given by I= 2Re(ρ21j12+ρ20j02) = 2Re( ρ21j12+e−iωt˜ρ20j02) . (37) The ﬁrst term in the right hand side of Eq. (37) is time- independent and will be referredto asthe DC component of the current, the second term in the right hand side of Eq. (37) is the AC component ofthe current. In a perfect ringj20= 0, thus an AC component in the current is a signature of ring distortion. Figs.4and5showthe DC component2Re( ρ21j12)and the amplitude of the AC component 2 |Re(˜ρ20j02)|of the\n6 FIG. 4: (Color online) (a) DC component and (b) the ampli- tude of the AC component of the radiation-induced current vs photon energy for diﬀerent distorted rings with the dis- tortion parameter ϕ=π/4 at high radiation power. Curves otherthan r2/r1= 0.99 were displaced for clarity. These plots were obtained using the parameters values κi,j= 0.001/planckover2pi1/ε, γi,j= 0.001/planckover2pi1/ε,eE0r1/ε= 0.1. radiation induced current for two values of the radiation intensity and diﬀerent distortion radii. The exact steady statesolutionsofEqs.(25)-(33)fortheseplotswerefound numerically. In the case of a high excitation power (Fig. 4) broad current peaks are observed. In the almost per- fect ring (r2/r1= 0.99 curve in Fig. 4(a)) the DC com- ponent has a single resonance peak. As the distortion degree increases, this peak shifts to a higher energy and its amplitude decreases (see r2/r1= 0.75 curve). For a stronger distortion ( r2/r1= 0.5) a second peak appears at a lower energy, which is related to the lower energy splitted level E1. Atr2/r1= 0.25 andr2/r1= 0.17 an additional negative current peak is observed. The am- plitude of the AC component of the persistent current is zerointheperfectring. Thisamplitudebecomesdiﬀerent than zero in distorted quantum rings with a maximum located in the region of the E2−E0resonance (Fig. 4). The complex dependence of the DC and AC persistent current components on the radiation frequency indicates FIG. 5: (Color online) (a) DC component and (b) the am- plitude of the AC component of the radiation-induced cur- rent vs photon energy at low radiation power. All calcula- tion parameters are the same with those in Fig. 4 except eE0r1/ε= 0.001. that signiﬁcant quantum-interference eﬀects are occur- ring. The current peaks are narrower in the case of low ra- diation power (see Fig. 5). Fig. 5(a) shows that the DC component is suppressed in quantum rings with strong distortion. In contrast, the amplitude of the AC com- ponent becomes non-zero in the distorted rings and in- creases with the distortion (Fig. 5(b)). The maximum of the AC component is located in the region of the E2−E0 resonance, as in the case of the high radiation power. We note that the sign change of Re(˜ ρ20j02) is responsible for the vertical lines in the peak centers in Fig. 5(b). In the regime of low radiation power we can ﬁnd an approximate solution of Eqs. (25)-(33). Eq. (32) gives the following expression for ˜ ρ20in the ﬁrst order in E0: ˜ρ20=−i/planckover2pi1 E2−E0−/planckover2pi1ω−i/planckover2pi1γ20v20+ρ00.(38) Similarly, from Eq. (28) ˜ ρ01in the ﬁrst order in E0can be found. This expression for ˜ ρ01together with Eq. (38)\n7 and Eq. (33) yields in the second order in E0 ρ21=i/planckover2pi1 E2−E1−i/planckover2pi1γ21/bracketleftbiggi/planckover2pi1 E2−E0−/planckover2pi1ω−i/planckover2pi1γ20+ i/planckover2pi1 E1−E0−/planckover2pi1ω−i/planckover2pi1γ01/bracketrightbigg v01−v20+ρ00.(39) We have found that the persistent current components calculated from Eqs. (37), (38), (39) with ρ0,0= 1 per- fectly coincides with the persistent current components calculated numerically in Fig. 5. In the case of a perfect ring the current can be seen as a X2eﬀect. The presence of a distorsion induces a X1term which corresponds to the AC component. V. CONCLUSIONS In conclusion, we have investigated persistent and radiation-induced currents in quantum rings with distor- tions. We have derived an eﬀective Schr¨ odinger equa- tion describing electrons in a narrow distorted quantum ring (closed loop) in the presence of an external mag- netic ﬁeld ﬂux. We have shown that the electron en- ergy spectrum is a periodic function ofthe magnetic ﬂux. The ring curvature enters into the eﬀective equations through a geometrical potential term. We have solved the equations in the case of a distorted ring consisting of four constant-curvature segments. We have consideredthe eﬀect of the ring distortion on the magnetic ﬂux- induced and radiation-induced currents. It was found that the eﬀect on the ﬂux-induced persistent current is more pronounced in quantum rings with a small number of electrons and lower chemical potential. The gaps at the points of intersection of the energy levels lead to a smoothing of the persistent current oscillations and to a diﬀerent temperature dependence. The persistent cur- rent in a distorted ring with a large number of electrons behaves like in a perfect ring with a diﬀerent radius in a renormalized magnetic ﬁeld. We have also found that the ring distortion aﬀects radiation-induced currents. Using a density matrix ap- proach and the rotating wave approximation, it was found that the current in distorted quantum rings ac- quires an AC component, in addition to the DC compo- nentcharacteristicofperfectrings. Thefrequencydepen- dence of the DC component is modiﬁed by the distortion and shows several peaks of diﬀerent sign. The frequency of the AC component is equal to the radiation frequency while its amplitude increaseswith the distortion. Finally, weremarkthatthenon-trivialdependenceoftheDCper- sistent currentcomponenton the radiationfrequency can be useful forquantumcontrolschemesinvolvinglocalized spins, as suggested in Ref. 22.
